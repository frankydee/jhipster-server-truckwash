/* TODO
 *
 * 1. Create entity for relationship between Customer and products services (including overriding sales price or discount)
 * 		- This should be also configuration at company level (or only company and not user?? 
 *
 * 2. Consider whether companies and customer should be stored in a single entiry (e.g. party) since the above would be easier 
 *
 * 3. Create a sensor entity which is linked to products and services.  This would include complex raw config data (only for me, not the users or system admin
 *   would be only available to the role "hardware admin" or something like that...
